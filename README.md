ACTS Activity API

## Backend

### Local MongoDB

This project includes a [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file for testing the full app setup with local containers. The frontend and backend code are developed on the local host but the local mongoDB can be ran and connected to.

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d

[+] Running 1/1
 â ¿ Container mongo  Started    0.4s
```

Once the local MongoDB container is running, the local `.env` file in the backend folder can be updated to use the local dev DB.

```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb://root:Cisc0123@localhost:27017/
```

### Development Setup

These APIs are written using Python 3.10 and the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework and dependencies are managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/).  
The `cmd.sh` helper script is written for usage with a unix based bash shell which is the default on Mac and Linux but within Windows you will need to utilize a linux kernel.

**In the `backend` folder**

Verify you have python 3.10 installed.

```bash
$ python3 --version

Python 3.10.9
```

Then you need to install poetry which will manage dependencies and the python virtual environment.

```bash
$ curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Install the required development and production project dependencies.

```bash
$ poetry install
```

You will need to have the production `.env` file in the backend folder in order to authenticate, connect to DBs, etc. and the required keys can be checked in the `.env-example` file.

Start the development server which will reload as changes are made and access the OpenAPI frontend at <http://localhost:8000>

```bash
$ ./cmd.sh start

```

### Code Quality

Code consistency, quality and formatting is maintained with the following tools.

- [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
- [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)
- [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

The `./cmd.sh format` command can be ran to format the project files which runs the tools with the following options. Most IDEs allow a `format on save` feature which is convient to setup with these configurations as well.

### Best Practices

- Include type hints for the parameters on functions
- Include docstrings on functions
- Minimize the number of funcitons in a single file instead opt for addional files with relevant names.
- Add pydantic models and enums within their own file for each API router

## Deployment

This project includes a [.gitlab-ci.yml](./.gitlab-ci.yml) configuration to build and deploy new containers to the CAE Openshift Kubernetes cluster with the following process.

- Update the Backend API version in [pyproject.toml](./backend/pyproject.toml)
- Update the API container image to the new version in [values.yaml](./infra/values.yaml)
- Update the Helm chart image in [Chart.yaml](./infra/chart.yaml)
- Update the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) with brief descriptions of the version changes
- Create and push the new API version tag
  - `git tag 1.0.2 && git push origin -u 1.0.2`

This will create a new container for the backend API code with the version set to the tag and update the API Kubernetes deployment to use the new container with helm. The frontend code will be built and copied to the persistent disk of the running NGINX server.
